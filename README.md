## What is OpenAnnounce?

OpenAnnounce is an open-source web application for displaying a list of announcements to users. Specifically, it is designed for use in schools to communicate information to staff and students through a simple web portal. OpenAnnounce is designed to be shown to users automatically, and so has a front page designed to be extremely simple and easy for users to read.

OpenAnnounce runs on an IIS web server using ASP.NET 4.0 and above, and is designed to be used with Windows authentication to automatically use domain credentials to view the page.
